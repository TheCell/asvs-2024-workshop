# Exercise #4 - Triage and prioritize

* Usually, triage will be done by the software engineering team, project management, the customer and – if available – an AppSec responsible Person

* Some of the findings might be less risky than others
  * Look at the OWAS top 10

* Try to triage the findings base on the risk
  * Use the threat model to evaluate the risks

* Triage also based on effort and budget
  * Given the fact you only have four developers and 10 days to fix the findings
