# Exercise #1 - Checklists

* Create three checklists, each per level

  * The checklists doesn’t include the previous level items.

  * A Level 2 project will need the Level 1 checklist.

  * A Level 3 project will need Level 2 and Level 1 checklists.

* This way the projects can add the checklists they need

  * A Level 2 project can be tested against Level 1 and Level 2 separately if needed.
  * Reporting will be easier using separate checklists
