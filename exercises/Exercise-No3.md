# Exercise #3 - Pentest

- Testing a software against a security standard to find known vulnerabilities.
- ASVS is one of the standards you can use to test against.
- Use the checklists you created before to test one item after another
- Focus on the risks identified with the threat model
- Use the checklists to track what you just tested and what to test.
- With the findings, you should write down the steps to reproduce and the tools you used to test specific items
- Track number of findings compared to the number of items to test
  - This helps comparing with the retest
  - As best, track per chapter
